# Overview

This is an example of what the coding standard could look like.

## Commenting

This is where we explain the best way and when to comment code.

> // This is one way to do it
>> Best for  short comments

> /* Here's another way */
>> Best for multiline comments

## Conditional Expressions

Here we have acceptable methodologies to implement conditional logic

> if something === true ? "Condition is true." : "Condition is false.";

## Security

Please reference the [Security Coding Standard](/Coding-Standard/Security/Security-Standard.md) for further info.
